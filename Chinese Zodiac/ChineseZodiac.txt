		In the Chinese Zodiac, twelve animals are used to represent years. A person's zodiac sign can be used to determine one's fortune for the year, compatibility in a marriage partner, career fit, and more. A zodiac system has existed in Chinese culture for more than 2,000 years, since about the time of the Qin Dynasty. 

	The zodiac cycles every twelve years and one's zodiac year is not considered lucky but an obstacle to overcome. One should wear red underwear every day in their zodiac year in order to protect themselves from bad fortune and evil spirits. 

	There are several origin stories for the Chinese Zodiac. Some say that the Buddha or the Jade Emperor called all animals to help humanity and only the twelve of the zodiac responded. Other traditions say that a Great Race was held to determine which animals would be in the zodiac forever. The later origin also accounts for the order of the animals.

	The original terms used for the years were Dì Zhī (地支), or Earthly Branches. These branches were also assigned to the hours of the day based on solar time. The zodiac animals were added later and are categorized as either yīn (阴) or yáng (阳).

	In addition to the Earthly Branches there are Ten Celestial Stems (天干—tiān gān) that make a 60 year calendar cycle. Although each zodiac has a fixed element, there is an additional element associated with the Ten Celestial Stems.
